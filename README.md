# PHSX815_Project1: How to run the code
On the command line, enter "python3.8 PHSX815_Project1.py" to run the simulations. In the 87th line of the code, please change the path of the file where you want the data to be saved (of 1 isolated run), in the form of a .csv file.
Here's how to interpret the outputs (details of which are elaborated in the project report):
1. The numbers: The numbers generated are the probabilities of obtaining heads when a coin is tossed thrice. It also gives an output of 'Heads' or 'Tails' after tossing the coin. We can also see the simulated and expected probabilities of obtaining 'Heads' during a coin-toss.
2. Plots: The first plot is that of a single run of the random walk. The second one is that of multiple runs plotted together (the number of times can be altered by altering the parameter n_simulations in line 84 of the code). The third one is just the second plot with the mean computed at each point.
