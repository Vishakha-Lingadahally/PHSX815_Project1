# PHSX815_Project1: How to run the code
On the command line, enter "python 'path/Random_walk.py'" to run the simulations and take a look at the different plots. The first plot is that of a single run of the random walk. The second one is that of multiple runs plotted together (the number of times can be altered by altering the parameter n_simulations in line 84 of the code). The third one is just the second plot with the mean computed at each point.
On the command line, enter "python 'path/Random_walk.py'" output > random_walk.txt. This will save the output of the sample (single trial) in a text file.
I'm still working on the part of the code that can analyse data from a text file. I will update the code as soon as I figure it out.
